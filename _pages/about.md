ðŸ¤–ðŸ“Š Currently working towards my BSc as a final year undergraduate student in the field of Data Science, Machine/Deep Learning and Machine Intelligence 

ðŸ’¡ I am interested in Deep Learning, Conversational AI, Data Science, Computer Vision and Machine Learning in general

ðŸ’»ðŸŽ¨ I creatively code (sometimes) and post it to [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/1024aesthetic/)!

## Professional Experience 

I spent a year working at London-based Conversational AI startup called OpenDialogAI as a **Software Engineer**! Though my job title was Software Engineer, I was spread across many disciplines involving PHP (Laravel) back-end, Vue.js front-end, AWS SageMaker for **testing and deploying LLMs in Python**, using testing frameworks liek Cypress and even IaC (Infrastructure as Code) using Terraform.
